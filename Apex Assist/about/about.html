      <h2>What is Apex Assist?</h2>
      <p>Apex Assist is a Chrome extension designed to automate quizzes and tests on Apex Learning using AI technology.</p>
      <p>The extension uses Google Gemini AI to analyze questions and provide accurate answers, making your learning experience smoother and more efficient.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p>Apex Assist analyzes the questions on your screen, processes them using advanced AI, and automatically selects the most likely correct answer. The extension supports both text-based questions and questions with images.</p>
      
      <ul class="feature-list">
        <li>Automatically reads questions and answer choices from the Apex Learning interface</li>
        <li>Processes images when necessary for context-rich questions</li>
        <li>Uses Google's Gemini AI to determine the correct answer</li>
        <li>Automatically selects the answer and moves to the next question</li>
        <li>Configurable delay between answers to mimic natural timing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The extension can be configured to deliberately miss some questions to make your results appear more natural and avoid detection.</p>
